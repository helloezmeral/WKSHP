    "# Introduction to the HPE Ezmeral ML Ops\n",
    "HPE Ezmeral Container Platform (HPE ECP) uses container technology to make it simpler and more cost-effective to deploy, run and manage both cloud-native and non-cloud-native applications for machine learning, deep learning, and big data analytics use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "HPE Ezmeral Machine Learning (ML) Ops extends the speed and agility of HPE ECP by bringing the power of containers to the entire ML lifecycle to enable users to build, train, share, deploy, and monitor ML models. Ezmeral ML Ops supports sandbox development (notebooks), distributed training, and the deployment and monitoring of trained models in production. To enable sharing model and data artifacts, Ezmeral ML Ops integrates Project repository, source control, and model registry capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will get started with some fundamental knowledge about how to interact with the HPE ECP control plane UI. We walk you, a tenant/project user, through step by step details to build, train, register and deploy the model. At the end of the session, you will be able to test model serving.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Lab Flow\n",
    "HackShack workshops are delivered through a central point that allows a portable, dynamic version of the lab guides. We are now leveraging a jupyterhub server on which all the different labs guides will be stored in a `Jupyter Notebook` format (*.ipynb). These Notebooks are accessible from the internet for the event.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides, the notebooks can be downloaded on to your own laptop for further usage or edition. In order to use  them, you will need to install the jupyter notebook application available [here](https://jupyter.org/install).\n",
    "Beginners guide available [here](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Documentation and Tools\n",
    "The Ezmeral ML Ops documentation is accessible from an HPE ECP deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the notebook we'll use python code for ML model building, data cleansing, training the model, and saving it in the project repository. Then, we will register the model and deploy it for inferencing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the hands-on lab exercises have been designed to run independently, it is recommended to proceed in the order below: \n",

    "# Lab Environment - HPE Ezmeral Container Platform Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "This high-level architecture diagram with its compute and storage components is shown below. \n",

    "Our HPE Ezmeral Controller Platform deployment includes:\n",
    "* The `Controller host` manages all the hosts that comprise the HPE Ezmeral Container Platform deployment.\n",
    "* The `EPIC hosts` are under the direct control of the Controller host, orchestrating the containerized applications.\n",
    "* The `Gateway host` acts as a proxy server that carries client requests (HPE ECP UI, REST API, K8s API (kubectl commands)) to the HPE ECP controller, to EPIC hosts or one of the K8s clusters the containerized application services running in EPIC or K8s clusters. Containerized application service endpoints are exposed from HPE ECP to users via the gateway re-mapped ports. \n",
    "* The `HPE Ezmeral Data Fabric` (a MapR File System) is a storage provider for persistent volumes for the applications that require persistence of data. The default StorageClass is available out of the box from the HPE Ezmeral Data Fabric (MapR) using the HPE Ezmeral Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver for MapR.\n",

    "# Lab 1: Intro and Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, each student will familiarize with the HPE Ezmeral ML Ops Project repository and set up an HPE Ezmeral ML Ops environment. You will create your own data and model folders in the project repository.\n",

    "# Lab 2: Model Development\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab will walk you through how you, as tenant or project member, perform typical machine learning model development tasks, including:\n",
    "* Data cleaning/preprocessing/visualization.\n",
    "* Iterative model development/training with different algorithms and parameters.\n",
    "* Save the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow the instructions in Lab 1 to setup the pre-requisites for Lab 2 and start with model building and training.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Lab 3: Model Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we will register and deploy the trained model for serving and test the model serving.\n",
